# About

*Vaporwave* is a tool to manage, synchronize and backup rom and save files between different devices (computer, retro
handhelds, smartphone, etc.) It's inspired in part from the e-books
manager [calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre).

Name is based on Steam (as the idea is to manage game and save files between devices). *Vaporwave* is also a term
associated with 90's nostalgia, and therefore with retro gaming.
